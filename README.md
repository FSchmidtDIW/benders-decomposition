# Decomposition algorithms for large-scale generation expansion planning models
In this repository I develop a set of stabilised decomposition algorithms for DIETER.jl, a generation expansion planning model for sector-coupled renewable energy systems.
It builds on prior work with @anygoeke on Benders Decomposition for energy system planning under climate uncertainty.
